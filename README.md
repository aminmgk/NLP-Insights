### NLP-Insights

#### Project Overview
Explore and implement various NLP approaches to extract valuable insights from text data. The project covers sentiment analysis, named entity recognition (NER), and topic modeling.

#### Project Structure

1. **Sentiment Analysis:**
   - **Description:** Implement sentiment analysis techniques to determine the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) of text data.
   - **Code:** `sentiment_analysis.py`
   - **Documentation:** Provide documentation on how sentiment analysis is implemented, including any external libraries or models used.

2. **Named Entity Recognition (NER):**
   - **Description:** Implement NER to identify and classify named entities (e.g., names, locations, organizations) in text data.
   - **Code:** `named_entity_recognition.py`
   - **Documentation:** Document the NER approach, algorithms, and any pre-trained models utilized.

3. **Topic Modeling:**
   - **Description:** Implement topic modeling techniques to identify key topics within a corpus of text.
   - **Code:** `topic_modeling.py`
   - **Documentation:** Explain the chosen topic modeling algorithm (e.g., Latent Dirichlet Allocation), parameters, and results.

4. **Datasets:**
   - **Description:** Provide sample datasets or links to datasets used for testing and demonstrating the NLP approaches.
   - **Directory:** `datasets/`
